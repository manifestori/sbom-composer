## MVP Fields that would need input from the user for composed SBOM
Document Name: SBOM-Composer report for <top level product name> (May be able to
automate this)
PackageName: Top Level Composed SBOM product
SPDXID: SPDXRef-composed-sbom-product
PackageVersion: tbd (would need input from user)
PackageDownloadLocation: Input from user or NOASSERTION
FilesAnalyzed: false (false indicates no package level analysis has been performed; would need
to check that this field is also false for mSBOMs during merge)
PackageChecksum: SHA256:
8c02234b86056c009036ff0c31efb9a726412392d9872dacf95103767ac3b101
PackageLicenseConcluded: license, licenseRef or NOASSERTION
PackageLicenseDeclared: license, licenseRef or NOASSERTION
PackageCopyrightText: text or NOASSERTION

# Optional and helpful fields needing input from the user for composed SBOM
PackageSupplier: Organization or recognized author of product
PackageComment <text>Any relevant comment</text>

## General approach for TV:
- The top-level 'document creation' and package section will require the most input from the
user. This could be on the command line but probably easier to have them input a JSON file
with the required information which can essentially be copy/pasted to the resulting document.
- mSBOM document creation info can be discarded since the newer top level document creation
section will take precedence.
- mSBOM package information can be copy/pasted into the resulting SBOM document
- 'Contains' relationships should be added under the primary top level package section
- If any of the license concluded or license declared fields use LicenseRef definitions, then the
accompanying LicenseID and LicenseText sections also need to be included. This should
mostly be covered by the copy/paste.
- All nested dependency relationships can be preserved.
- LicenseList versions should be compared and hopefully the same. If not the same, use the
newer value.

-SPDXVersion values should be the same. If not, use the newer version value in the composed
SBOM.
- `Relationship: SPDXRef-DOCUMENT DESCRIBES <msbom product name>` from msboms
can be discarded but we can use this line to get the mSBOM product name.
- PackageVerificationCode must be removed if filesanalyzed is false (which is required for no
files)
- If duplicate package checksum, we can omnit one.

## Other notes
- The tools-spdx repo parser is not working and hasn't been updated in a while. They've asked
for help with this...
